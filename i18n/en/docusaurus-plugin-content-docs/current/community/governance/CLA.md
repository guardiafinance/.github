Thank you for your interest in contributing to Guardia's projects. This **Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")** ensures clarity about intellectual property rights related to your Contributions, protecting the Contributor, Guardia, and other users.

Please read this document carefully before signing it. Keep a copy for your records.

## 1. Definitions

**"Contributor"** means the individual or entity that owns the copyright in the contribution.

**"Contribution"** means any work of original authorship (including code, documentation, tests, or examples) intentionally submitted to Guardia, by any means, including but not limited to Pull Request, for inclusion in its projects.

**"Project"** means any repository, module, documentation, or artifact under Guardia's control, whether these repositories are public, private, internal, or hosted on other official domains and infrastructure of the organization, including, but not limited to, https://github.com/guardiafinance.

**"Guardia"** is the private legal entity registered under CNPJ nº 58.771.503/0001-40, which operates in the technology sector, developing open source and enterprise technology, to serve fintechs seeking to optimize financial infrastructure solutions.

## 2. License

Unless otherwise expressly indicated and documented at the time of submission, all Contributions submitted to Guardia's **Projects** will be licensed under the terms of the **Apache License, Version 2.0** (the **"License"**).

The complete text of the **License** is available at: [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

By submitting a **Contribution**, the **Contributor** agrees that it may be redistributed and used under the terms of the **License**, including in derivative works or modified versions of Guardia's **Projects**.

## 3. Grant of Copyright License

The **Contributor** grants to **Guardia** and users of the **Projects** a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

- Reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and distribute their **Contributions**;
- Create derivative works from them; and
- Sub-license these rights to third parties.

## 4. Grant of Patent License

The **Contributor** also grants a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable (except as provided below), non-exclusive, royalty-free license for any patent owned by them that is necessary for the use, modification or distribution of the **Contributions**, whether alone or combined with Guardia's **Projects**.

This license will be automatically revoked if the **Contributor** initiates patent infringement litigation related to the **Project** or the **Contributions**.

## 5. Representations and Warranties

By accepting these terms, the **Contributor** confirms that:

1. They are authorized to participate and share their **contributions** with the **project**, with no relevant contractual impediment (such as conflict of interest clauses with employers or third parties);
2. The **contributions** are of their authorship. If there is any third-party content, the **Contributor** ensures that such material is properly identified and licensed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
3. If contributing on behalf of a company or organization, the **Contributor** declares that they have proper authorization to do so — either by internal decision or through a **Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)**;
4. They will adopt reasonable care to ensure that their **contributions** do not have viruses, malware, backdoors or other codes intentionally harmful to the security, integrity or stability of the projects. Furthermore, the **Contributor** acknowledges that the responsibility for final review and validation of **contributions** lies with the project maintainers;
5. They understand that some obligations provided in this Agreement, such as those related to licensing, liability and legal compliance, may remain valid even after the termination of this Agreement;
6. If their **contributions** involve the processing of personal data, the **Contributor** guarantees that they will do so in compliance with Law nº 13.709/2018 (General Data Protection Law – LGPD) and other applicable legislation on privacy and data protection.

The **Contributor** declares that they possess the necessary rights over the **contributions** made and that they do not infringe third-party rights. They also commit to adopting reasonable care to ensure the security and integrity of the code. Should third-party questions arise, and there being proven bad faith or gross negligence, the **Contributor** commits to collaborate in the solution and assume any responsibilities.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

Except as required by law or agreed to in writing, all **Contributions** are provided **"AS IS"**, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement.

The **Contributor** declares that they make their **Contributions** in good faith, but offers no warranty regarding their functionality, security, accuracy and technical or legal compliance, nor commits to error correction or continuous support.

**Guardia** acknowledges that, except in cases of proven malice or bad faith, the **Contributor** may not be held liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages, losses, operational failures or legal disputes arising from the use, modification or redistribution of **Contributions**, even if these come to be incorporated into the organization's **Projects**.

## 7. Support

The **Contributor** has no contractual obligation to provide support, maintenance or technical assistance for **Contributions** made to Guardia's **Projects**. Collaboration is performed spontaneously, based on the principles of free and voluntary contribution.

Should the **Contributor** wish to offer technical support, clarifications or updates regarding their **Contributions**, they may do so voluntarily and non-bindingly, either free of charge or for remuneration agreed outside the terms of this Agreement, through a separate instrument.

Any provision of support does not alter the free nature of the original **Contribution**, nor creates employment relationship, continuity obligation or expectation of future consideration by **Guardia** or its representatives.

## 8. Third-Party Contributions

Should the **Contributor** wish to submit content that is not of their direct authorship — including, but not limited to code snippets, libraries, configuration files, documentation, images, or examples — they must clearly identify this origin at the time of submission, using the following indication:

**"Submitted on behalf of third parties: [author name/license]."**

Additionally, the **Contributor** must inform, whenever possible, the applicable licensing terms, and ensure that such terms are compatible with the objectives and licenses of Guardia's **Projects**. The responsibility for verifying the origin and authorization for use of third-party content lies with the **Contributor**.

**Guardia** reserves the right to refuse or exclude **Contributions** that do not present due clarity regarding copyright ownership or that may represent legal risk for the **Projects** or their users.

## 9. Updates

The **Contributor** commits to promptly inform **Guardia** should they become aware of any fact, circumstance or element that makes any of the declarations, warranties or information provided under this Agreement false, inaccurate or outdated.
This obligation includes, for example, but is not limited to:
- Changes in copyright ownership over the **Contribution**;
- Conflicts or disputes over the origin of submitted content;
- Subsequent identification of unauthorized use of third-party code;
- Substantial modifications in the licensing of external dependencies used.

This update is essential to ensure the legal and technical integrity of Guardia's **Projects** and to guarantee the trust of the involved community.

## 10. Voluntary Nature of Contribution

The **Contributor** acknowledges that they make their **Contributions** voluntarily, without expectation of remuneration, financial compensation or formal recognition by **Guardia**, its partners or project users.

The signing of this **CLA** does not establish any employment, partnership, representation, partnership or mandate relationship between the **Contributor** and **Guardia**. This agreement does not create any obligation for continued service provision, nor labor, social security or tax rights of any nature.

Without prejudice to the above, the **Contributor** may publicly reference their participation in the project in resumes, portfolios and professional profiles or on social networks, using the designation: **"OSS Contributor | Guardia ({Project or Module Name})"**, in badge or text format, at their discretion. Such recognition is optional and does not imply formal relationship with **Guardia**. **Guardia** reserves the right to request adjustments in the use of this designation should it misrepresent the relationship between the parties, violate trademark usage rules or cause confusion regarding official roles.

## 11. No Obligation of Use

The **Contributor** acknowledges that **Guardia** has no obligation to review, accept, use, incorporate or distribute their **Contributions** in any **Project**, even if these are technically correct, compatible with the platform architecture or in compliance with the coding standards used.

The decision on acceptance, modification, rejection or disposal of a **Contribution** lies exclusively with the maintenance team of Guardia's **Projects**, indicated by the CODEOWNERS file present in the corresponding repository or, in its absence, by the Steering Committee. This decision will be made based on technical, strategic criteria, alignment with the roadmap and with the interests of the community and organization.

This Agreement does not grant the **Contributor** any legitimate expectation of acceptance or permanence of the **Contribution**, nor generates notification or justification obligation by **Guardia** regarding the final destination of submitted material.

## 12. Assignment

The **Contributor** agrees that **Guardia** may, at its sole discretion, assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, as well as all rights, obligations, licenses and responsibilities arising from it, to any third party that assumes, formally or informally, the governance, maintenance, support or continuity of one or more **Projects** of the organization.

Such assignment may occur, including in contexts of corporate reorganization, merger, spin-off, acquisition, incorporation, asset transfer or creation of foundations or specific management entities for the **Projects**. **Guardia** may carry out this assignment without need for prior consent from the **Contributor**, provided that the third-party assignee fully assumes the terms and commitments established in this Agreement.

The **Contributor** acknowledges that this possibility of assignment is fundamental to ensure the continuity, permanence and scalability of Guardia's **Projects**, including in scenarios of international expansion, governance migration or integration with broader technological ecosystems.

## 13. Retroactive Effect

This Agreement applies to all **Contributions** made by the **Contributor** to **Guardia** **before and after the date of its signature**, provided that these **Contributions** have been submitted voluntarily and have not been the subject of a specific distinct contract with **Guardia**. By signing this Agreement, the **Contributor** ratifies and confirms that all previous **Contributions** become automatically subject to the same terms and conditions established herein.

## 14. Waiver of Moral Rights

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the **Contributor waives and agrees not to claim any moral rights** relating to their **Contributions**, for the benefit of **Guardia**, its licensees, partners and users, allowing free modification, adaptation and distribution of the same.

## 15. Conflict Resolution

Any and all controversy, doubt or litigation arising from this Agreement ("Conflict") will preferably be resolved amicably.

The party feeling harmed must send extrajudicial notification to the other party, detailing the foundations of the Conflict, the intended solution and granting a period of 10 (ten) calendar days for the other party to:

- accept the presented proposal;
- present counter-proposal for amicable solution;
- substantiate their refusal, in case they disagree with any of the previous alternatives.

Additionally, if the parties agree, an impartial technical third party may be appointed to issue **non-binding opinion**, with the objective of facilitating a consensual solution with technical and objective basis.

If consensus is not reached, the parties commit to submit the **Conflict** to **private mediation**, to be conducted by a **recognized Arbitration and Mediation Chamber**, based in São Paulo/SP, according to the chamber's regulations and under the terms of **Law nº 13.140/2015**. Mediation will be conducted by an impartial mediator, chosen by mutual agreement, and may be performed in person or remotely. The mediator's fees will be divided equally between the parties.

If the impasse persists, the **Conflict** will be submitted to **Common Justice**, with the **Forum of the Capital of the State of São Paulo** being elected as competent to resolve any issues arising from this Agreement, with express waiver of any other, however privileged it may be.

## 16. Termination

This Agreement may be terminated at any time, through formal written notification to **Guardia**, **exclusively at the Contributor's initiative**. Termination will not affect licenses already granted nor any **Contribution** previously submitted and accepted.
