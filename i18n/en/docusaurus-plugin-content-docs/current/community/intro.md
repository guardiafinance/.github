# Our Commitment

Guardia is a company that values the open source community and is firmly committed to contributing to the development of open source software. We believe that open source is the best way to create high-quality software, in an efficient, secure, and collaborative manner, driving innovation and continuous evolution.

In the financial market, to which we are closely connected, the open source community has played a key role in accelerating innovation, reducing costs, and promoting security and transparency. Initiatives such as Pix and Drex benefit not only from the expertise of major players like The Linux Foundation and Red Hat, but also from an active and collaborative community that continuously contributes to the evolution of these platforms.

Furthermore, we believe that the open source community plays a fundamental role in economic and social development. It empowers new professionals, promotes social inclusion, and democratizes access to technology, creating opportunities for everyone and helping to build a more equitable future.

Our commitment is to support, participate, and actively contribute to this community, reinforcing the values of transparency, collaboration, and excellence that define open source.

We want participation to be accessible to everyone and for everyone to feel welcome to contribute, overcoming language barriers. That's why we've decided to maintain our main documentation in three languages: Portuguese, English, and Spanish.
