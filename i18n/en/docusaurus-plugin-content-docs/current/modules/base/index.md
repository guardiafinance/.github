# Banking System Engine

**BASE (Banking System Engine)** is Guardia's financial product creation engine — designed to give fintechs, digital banks, and companies operating financial services the freedom to build robust solutions with agility, governance, and flexibility.

With BASE, you can structure accounts with multiple holders, define balance positions in different currencies (fiat and non-fiat), and implement Smart Flows to orchestrate end-to-end automated behaviors. All while maintaining complete control over the business rules that define your product.

We created BASE for those who need to scale consistently — whether launching a new digital wallet, managing payment accounts, segmenting operational flows, or configuring multi-entity structures.

In the Open Core model, BASE is available for free with essential features. For operations requiring higher throughput, isolated environments, and dedicated support, we also offer provisioned versions as part of our PaaS offering.

You can access the official BASE image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/guardiafinance) and explore community resources.

If you want to use BASE in production with high availability and full support, contact our commercial team through the [contact form](https://guardia.finance/#contact-us) or our [Discord](#) channel.
