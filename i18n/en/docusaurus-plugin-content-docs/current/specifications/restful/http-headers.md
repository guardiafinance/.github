# Headers

This specification describes the standard and custom headers adopted by Guardia in its RESTful APIs.

Its goal is to promote consistency between interfaces, ensure predictability in data consumption, and facilitate interoperability between internal modules, external services, and partner integrations.

Header standardization contributes to efficient traceability, secure debugging, and integration scalability.

## Summary

| Header                  | Type     | Category | Direction | Mandatory | Purpose                                 |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| [Cache-Control](#cache-control)           | string   | standard  | Response  | Optional  | Cache control directives            |
| [X-Grd-Debug](#x-grd-debug)             | boolean  | custom    | Request   | Optional  | Enables debug information return     |
| [X-Grd-Trace-Id](#x-grd-trace-id)          | uuid     | custom    | Response  | Mandatory | Internal traceability                   |
| [X-Grd-Correlation-Id](#x-grd-correlation-id)    | uuid     | custom    | Req/Resp  | Optional  | External context propagation            |


## Standard Headers

### Cache-Control

The `Cache-Control` header field MUST be used to guide caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.

#### Response

The cache MUST be configured with the `max-age=<seconds>` directive, preceded by:

- `public`, when the cache can be shared among multiple users;

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=<seconds>
```

- `private`, when the cache is exclusive to the end user.

```http
Cache-Control: private, max-age=<seconds>
```

For responses that **MUST NOT** be cached, the following header MUST be used:

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
```

Other directives may be added as needed, following [RFC 9111: HTTP Caching](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#section-5.2).

---

## Custom Headers

Custom headers used by Guardia follow the `X-Grd-*` prefix convention. They address specific needs for traceability, debugging, and correlation between systems.

### X-Grd-Debug

Optional boolean header. When present with the value `true`, the response MUST include the `debug` field in the payload, containing additional information according to the [response payloads specification](./http-response-payloads.md#debug).

```http
X-Grd-Debug: true
```

**Default value:** `false`

**Warning:** usage in production environments MUST be restricted, as it may expose sensitive information.

---

### X-Grd-Trace-Id

Mandatory header returned in **all responses** from Guardia APIs. Represents the unique request identifier.

- Generated by Guardia's infrastructure.
- Facilitates log and event correlation between services.
- The value MUST follow the UUIDv7 standard, with temporal marking as specified in [RFC 9562](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562#name-uuid-version-7).

```http
X-Grd-Trace-Id: <uuid>
```

---

### X-Grd-Correlation-Id

Optional header sent by external systems. Used to propagate tracking context throughout distributed calls.

- If present in the request, it MUST be included in the response.
- The value MUST follow the standard proposed by [RFC 9562](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562).

```http
X-Grd-Correlation-Id: <uuid>
```

---

## Security Considerations

- The use of `X-Grd-Debug: true` in production environments MUST be controlled by scope or authentication.
- Tracking headers **MUST NOT** contain sensitive data, PII, or secrets.
- Requests must be validated regardless of authentication status.
